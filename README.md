# 🚀 Quant Investment Framework

**A modular Python framework for automated stock analysis, portfolio optimization, and smart execution strategies.**

This project bridges the gap between **Value Investing** (Warren Buffett's principles) and **Quantitative Finance** (Modern Portfolio Theory & Algorithmic Trading). It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate how data science can streamline the investment decision-making process.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Features

### 1. Fundamental Screener (The "Buffett" Filter) 💎
Instead of analyzing thousands of stocks manually, the framework scrapes the **S&P 500** and filters companies based on strict fundamental criteria inspired by value investing:
* **High Return on Equity (ROE):** Ensures management is efficient with capital (>15%).
* **Low Debt-to-Equity:** Avoids over-leveraged companies (<1.0).
* **Healthy Profit Margins:** Ensures the business model is robust.
* **Reasonable Valuation (PEG):** Filters out extremely overvalued hype stocks.

### 2. Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz Theory) 📊
Once the "quality" stocks are selected, the framework determines **how much** of each to buy.
* It uses **Mean-Variance Optimization** (Modern Portfolio Theory).
* It calculates the **Sharpe Ratio** (Return / Risk) for various weight combinations.
* **Goal:** To maximize the expected return for a given level of volatility. It prevents putting "all eggs in one basket."

### 3. Smart DCA Strategy (Dynamic Entry) 📉
Standard Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) buys the same amount every month, regardless of price. This framework implements a **"Smart" DCA** based on the **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
* **The Logic:** RSI measures the speed and change of price movements (0–100).
* **Oversold (RSI < 30):** The asset is statistically cheap/panicked. **Action:** Aggressive Buy (e.g., 2x multiplier).
* **Overbought (RSI > 70):** The asset is expensive/hyped. **Action:** Pause or reduce buying.
* **Result:** This approach aims to lower the average entry price more effectively than blind DCA.
